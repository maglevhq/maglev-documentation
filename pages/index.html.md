# Introduction

Maglev is a page builder like Elementor or Divi but that you can plug in any Ruby on Rails application.&#x20;

It's composed of 2 major features:

* a top notch visual editor UI
* a CMS rendering engine

Maglev comes in 2 flavors:

* an open source version for a single site. Great if you want to add a site to your existing Rails application
* a licensed version if you want to use it to build your own multi-sites / multi themes platform and compete with Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, ...etc.
