# Overview

## Lego bricks

Based on our experience of crafting sites for various clients, we came to the conclusion that most of the time a site is composed of various marketing or content oriented bricks stacked in a vertical up-down direction.

We can say for sure it's definitively not just a trend in the web design world simply because it's the best way possible to read easily the content of a site.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Maglev, we named **sections** those "Lego" bricks.
{% endhint %}

To give you a good example of what a section could be, here are some screenshots from our library of sections:

## A top notch editor

We've been building CMS UI for almost 10 years now so we've got a pretty accurate vision of how content editors use a CMS to edit the content of their site.

So we  put a lot of efforts to build a pixel perfect editor as good as what the leaders of the CMS market provides.

## A toolset for developers

We're passionated developers and we know that both a great documentation and the tooling are what developers expect those days.

This is why we've developed:

* a couple of nice code generators to increase your efficiency.
* an developer panel so that you've got a clear vision of what's going on in Maglev.
