## Lego bricks

Based on our experience of crafting sites for various clients, we came to the conclusion that most of the time a site is composed of various marketing or content oriented bricks stacked in a vertical up-down direction.&#x20;

We can say for sure it's definitively not just a trend in the web design world simply because it's the best way possible to read easily the content of a site.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In Maglev, we named **sections** those "Lego" bricks.
{% endhint %}

To give you a good example of what a section could be, here are some screenshots from our library of sections:

![Menu section + Hero section.](https://1311630049-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-Me54MJUO0o8Vj5WCTWJ%2F-Me6vqREHE-inlr5oK0O%2F-Me6wiF0IVpyN_-shAa9%2Fsection-02.jpg?alt=media\&token=069eb516-1653-43fa-b7f9-8bba68141969)

![Section listing the properties in a real-estate agency website.](https://1311630049-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-Me54MJUO0o8Vj5WCTWJ%2F-Me6vqREHE-inlr5oK0O%2F-Me6wrh_Z30kWkR3TAn7%2Fsection-01.jpg?alt=media\&token=8f07f772-1ca0-4267-8639-34e9ba7cab26)

## The Rails way

## A top notch editor

We've been building CMS UI for almost 10 years now so we've got a pretty accurate vision of how content editors use a CMS to edit the content of their site.

So we  put a lot of efforts to build a pixel perfect editor as good as what the leaders of the CMS market provides.&#x20;

TODO: screenshot of the editor. GIF maybe?

## A toolset for developers

We're passionated developers and we know that both a great documentation and the tooling are what developers expect those days.&#x20;

This is why we've developed:

* a couple of nice code generators to increase your efficiency.
* an developer panel so that you've got a clear vision of what's going on in Maglev.
