# Introduction



{% hint style="info" %}
Please visit our[ new MaglevPRO site](https://www.maglev.dev/saas-edition) to learn more it.
{% endhint %}

The open source version of Maglev only allows you to create and edit one single site. 

The PRO version overpasses this limitation by making the multi-sites and multi-themes functionalities available.

It becomes then the best dev tool to build your own custom page builder platform.

Basically, you can set up hundreds of websites in a few clicks for your clients or franchisees and more important, you can do it from your own Ruby on Rails application. 

It's the perfect CMS for:

* **Franchisers:** You want to offer a beautiful and easy to maintain site to each of your franchisees.
* **Marketing companies**: You want to build microsites for small web presence and landing pages for PPC campaigns.
* **Online Services:** Developing/hosting sites is not part of your core business but your clients ask for that functionality.
* **Others**: You have neither the time nor the dev team to develop a site builder but you need one to launch your new awesome project.
