# CLI Commands

Maglev provides several Rails commands to help you manage your site, sections, and locales from the command line. These commands are designed to make common administrative tasks easier and more efficient.

## Site Management Commands

### Create a Site

Creates a new Maglev site with the first available theme.

```bash
bin/rails maglev:create_site
```

**What it does:**
- Checks if a site already exists
- Creates a new site using the first available local theme
- Provides feedback on success or if a site already exists

**Example output:**
```
ðŸŽ‰ Your site has been created with success!
```

**Error case:**
```
ðŸ¤” You already have a site. ðŸ¤”
```

### Change Site Locales

Updates the locales configuration for your site. This is useful for setting up multilingual sites.

```bash
bin/rails maglev:change_site_locales [label:prefix label2:prefix2 ...]
```

**Parameters:**
- `label`: The display name for the locale (e.g., "English", "FranÃ§ais")
- `prefix`: The URL prefix for the locale (e.g., "en", "fr", "" for default)

**Examples:**

Set up English and French locales:
```bash
bin/rails maglev:change_site_locales "English:en" "FranÃ§ais:fr"
```

Set up a single locale with no prefix (default):
```bash
bin/rails maglev:change_site_locales "English:"
```

**What it does:**
- Validates the locale format (must be `label:prefix`)
- Updates the site's locale configuration
- Provides feedback on success or validation errors

**Example output:**
```
Success! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
```

```
[Error] You don't seem to have an existing site. ðŸ¤”
[Error] make sure your locales follow the 'label:prefix' pattern. ðŸ¤“
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"You don't seem to have an existing site"**
- Make sure you've run `bin/rails maglev:create_site` first
- Check that your database is properly set up

**"No theme found"**
- Ensure you have at least one theme in your `app/theme/` directory
- Check that your theme files are properly formatted

**"No section of type found"**
- Verify the section type name is correct (case-sensitive)
- Check that sections of this type actually exist in your site
