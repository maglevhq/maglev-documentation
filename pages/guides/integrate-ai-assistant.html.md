# AI Assistant Integration

{% description %}
Using the Maglev LLM Markdown File in IDEs to increase your productivity!
{% enddescription %}

Maglev provides a combined markdown file (`full_site.md`) containing all documentation pages. This file is designed to be consumed by local AI tools, such as those integrated in modern IDEs, to help developers build Maglev sections more efficiently.

This guide explains how to set up and use the `full_site.md` file in Cursor (the first IDE we cover). Instructions for other IDEs will be added soon.

## Download the Markdown File

Download the latest Maglev documentation markdown file from:

[https://docs.maglev.dev/assets/ai/full_site.md](https://docs.maglev.dev/assets/ai/full_site.md)

Save this file somewhere in your project or on your local machine.

## ![](cursor-logo.svg) Add the Markdown File to Cursor

1. **Open Cursor** and your Maglev project.
2. **Open the AI Assistant panel** (usually accessible via the sidebar or with a shortcut like `Cmd+I`).
3. **Locate the "Knowledge" or "Custom Docs" section** in the AI Assistant settings.
4. **Add `full_site.md` as a knowledge source**:
    - Click "Add file" or "Import markdown" (the exact wording may vary).
    - Select the `full_site.md` file you downloaded.
5. **Save or apply the changes.**

The AI assistant in Cursor will now use the Maglev documentation to answer your questions, generate code, and provide context-aware help based on your own docs.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Download the latest `full_site.md`** whenever you want the most up-to-date documentation.
- **Keep the file up to date** in Cursorâ€™s knowledge base.
- **Ask specific questions** in Cursor referencing Maglev features, sections, or code examples.

## Other IDEs

Instructions for integrating the markdown file with other IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) will be added here soon.
